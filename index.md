# About Me 

 Hello, I am Sandeep Thalapanane and I enjoy designing and developing robotic systems. Right now, I am pursuing a Master's in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. In 2020, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, India. 

> Motivation - "What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean."

## Where I've worked

#### Flextronics
 - Senior Analyst (April 2021 to August 2022)

   - Performed multiple daily procurement functions such as handling purchase orders over $6 million worth of electronic parts during covid critical times, efficiently met inventory targets of 1 million USD using BAAN ERP software, and coordinated with vendors and suppliers from all parts of the world to meet the desired targets.
   - Augmented understanding of the procurement process & supply chain management.
  
## Projects I've Done

#### Camera pose estimation by using own Homography and Hough transform functions	                     	
 - March 2023

   - Developed an algorithm to compute the rotation and translation between a camera and a coordinate frame placed on a sheet of paper, without relying on OpenCV's built-in Homography and Hough transform.
   - Implemented computer vision techniques such as image thresholding, edge detection, and contour detection to extract the coordinates of the corner points of the sheet of paper.

#### Implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm for path planning of a Point Robot 	                     	
 - March 2023

   - Developed an implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm in Python to find the shortest path between two points in a map with obstacles, using a graph representation of the map and utilizing data structures such as priority queues to efficiently store and process the graph data.
   - Integrated the algorithm with a Pygame animation to visualize the resulting explored nodes and optimal path. Also enabled users to select start and goal points.
   - Demonstrated a deep understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science and mathematics, including graph theory, algorithm analysis, and data structures.

#### Implementation of the Breadth First Search algorithm for solving 8 puzzle problem                     	
 - March 2023

   - Developed an implementation of the BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm in Python to find the shortest path between an initial state and a goal state in the 8 puzzle problem, which involves sliding numbered tiles in a 3x3 grid
   - Integrated the algorithm with another python script to visualize the shortest path in the terminal by backtracking from goal state to initial stae.
   - Demonstrated proficiency in algorithms and data structures, as well as familiarity with Python.

#### Ball tracking and finding trajectory using OpenCV	                     	
 - March 2023

   - Developed a computer vision algorithm to track a ball in a video stream, using techniques such as color segmentation.
   - Used RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to robustly fit a curve to the ball's trajectory by implementing least squares, even in the presence of noise, outliers, or occlusions.

#### Modeling of a High speed camera mobile manipulator                       	
 - October 2022 to December 2022

   - Designed a High speed camera robot arm model with a mobile platform and formulated the Kinematics and Dynamics of the robot links.
   - Built a ROS package and simulated in a custom made Gazebo environment and visualized camera attached at the end effector using RViz. 
   - Developed a python program to operate robot arms, camera and reach the desired position by moving the robot using a mobile platform and planned trajectories using MoveIt.

#### Implementing the Wall following Algorithm to drive a robot to a goal       	
 - November 2022

   - Formulated the structure of the C++ program using OOP, pointers, and classes.
   - Wrote two types of wall following algorithm using left hand rule and right hand rule to reach a goal in a maze if the goal is adjacent to one of the outer walls of the maze.
   - Programmed to turn around the robot, when it reaches dead ends in the maze and continue to follow the algorithm.

#### Designing LQR and LQG controller for a crane system
 - December 2022

   - Calculated the equations of motion for the system using the Lagrangian method and the corresponding nonlinear state-space representation.
   - Linearized the system around the equilibrium point and designed an LQR controller for the linearized system and certified the stability using Lyapunov indirect method.
   - Designed an LQG controller for the nonlinear system and obtained the best Luenberger observer for each one of the output vectors.

#### Performance and emission analysis on a CI engine using soapnut biodiesel by varying injection timing
 - January 2020 to Septemnber 2021

   - Extracted soapnut oil from soapnut seeds and reduced viscosity of soapnut oil by using Transesterification. 
   - Tested blended soapnut oil in CI Engine by varying injection timing.
   - Analyzed the results and inferred that the change in performance characteristics was not quite significant, whereas the variation in the emission characteristics was considerable.
   - Concluded that the soap nut biodiesel is more advantageous when compared to the diesel in terms of availability, eco friendly, price and ease of use.

#### Design and fabrication of a PCM integrated solar still
 - August 2020 to December 2020

   - Designed & fabricated a solar desalination system using water as PCM in copper tubes and glass wool as insulation material.
   - The experiment was conducted throughout the day in the sunlight and measured the productivity of solar still on an hourly basis at the night.
   - It was evident from the results that, when water was used as PCM by storing in the copper tubes, the yield increased from 10 percent to 24 percent.
