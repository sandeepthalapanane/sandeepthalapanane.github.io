# About Me 

 Hello, I am Sandeep Thalapanane and I enjoy designing and developing robotic systems. Right now, I am pursuing a Master's in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. In 2020, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, India. After my bachelor's, I worked at Flextronics as a Senior Analyst in the Procurement Divison of a manufacturing plant for nearly 1 year and 4 months.

> Motivation - "What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean."

## Where I've worked

- Flextronics
  - Senior Analyst	(April 2021 – August 2022)
    - Performed multiple daily procurement functions such as handling purchase orders over $6 million worth of electronic parts during covid critical times, efficiently met inventory targets of $1 million using BAAN ERP software, and coordinated with vendors and suppliers from all parts of the world to meet the desired targets.
    - Augmented understanding of the procurement process & supply chain management.
