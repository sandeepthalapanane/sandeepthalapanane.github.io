# About Me 

 Hello, I am Sandeep Thalapanane and I enjoy designing and developing robotic systems. Right now, I am pursuing a Master's in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. In 2020, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Anna University, India. 

> Motivation - "What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean."

## Where I've worked

#### Flextronics
 - Senior Analyst (April 2021 to August 2022)

   - Performed multiple daily procurement functions such as handling purchase orders over $6 million worth of electronic parts during covid critical times, efficiently met inventory targets of 1 million USD using BAAN ERP software, and coordinated with vendors and suppliers from all parts of the world to meet the desired targets.
   - Augmented understanding of the procurement process & supply chain management.
  
## Projects I've Done

#### Modeling of a High speed camera mobile manipulator                       	
 - October 2022 to December 2022

   - Designed a High speed camera robot arm model with a mobile platform and formulated the Kinematics and Dynamics of the robot links.
   - Built a ROS package and simulated in a custom made Gazebo environment and visualized camera attached at the end effector using RViz. 
   - Developed a python program to operate robot arms, camera and reach the desired position by moving the robot using a mobile platform and planned trajectories using MoveIt.

#### Implementing the Wall following Algorithm to drive a robot to a goal       	
 - November 2022

   - Formulated the structure of the C++ program using OOP, pointers, and classes.
   - Wrote two types of wall following algorithm using left hand rule and right hand rule to reach a goal in a maze if the goal is adjacent to one of the outer walls of the maze.
   - Programmed to turn around the robot, when it reaches dead ends in the maze and continue to follow the algorithm.

#### Designing LQR and LQG controller for a crane system
 - December 2022

   - Calculated the equations of motion for the system using Lagrangian method and the corresponding nonlinear state-space representation.
   - Linearized the system around the equilibrium point and designed a LQR controller for the linearized system and certified the stability using Lyapunov indirect method.
   - Designed a LQG controller for the nonlinear system and obtained best Luenberger observer for each one of the output vectors.

#### Performance and emission analysis on a CI engine using soapnut biodiesel by varying injection timing
 - January 2020 to Septemnber 2021

   - Extracted soapnut oil from soapnut seeds and reduced viscosity of soapnut oil by using Transesterification. 
   - Tested blended soapnut oil in CI Engine by varying injection timing.
   - Analyzed the results and inferred that the change in performance characteristics was not quite significant, whereas the variation in the emission characteristics was considerable.
   - Concluded that the soap nut biodiesel is more advantageous when compared to the diesel in terms of availability, eco friendly, price and ease of use.

#### Design and fabrication of a PCM integrated solar still
 - August 2020 to December 2020

   - Designed & fabricated a solar desalination system using water as PCM in copper tubes and glass wool as insulation material.
   - The experiment was conducted throughout the day in the sunlight and measured the productivity of solar still on an hourly basis at the night.
   - It was evident from the results that, when water was used as PCM by storing in the copper tubes, the yield increased from 10 percent to 24 percent.
